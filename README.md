# Vagrant-Ethereum Box
A *real environment*-friendly *virtual environment* for development on Ethereum

* Want a (real) Ethereum node running locally on your machine for development?
* Want sub-second block times?
* Don't like it when your laptop roars like it's about to take off and becomes so hot, you can literally make breakfast on it?
* Like trees, polar bears, squirrels and those weird tiny monkeys living in Amazon forests?


... then stop ~being a dick~ mining in dev and use this Box.

## Dependencies

* [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
* nfsd (pre-installed on OS X, typically a simple package install on Linux)

## Usage:

`vagrant up` from wherever you cloned this, wait, then RPC the shit out of `http://localhost:8545`.

## How does this work?

Do you really give a shit?
